## How to run the BERT based Chatbot:
#### 1. make sure that the path of the datasets are correct, change if needed(use the datasets from RawData folder, the ones we made);
#### 2. in order to run the chatbot, move the trained model folder in the path DataPreprocessing/BERT_Impl then run the file BERT_implementation(it is a large file so I could not add it to Github)
#### 3. write the question in the terminal.

## How to run SVM classifier:
#### 1. run the file: DataPreprocessing/SVM/predict.py, then the file: src/main/java/org/implementation/SVM/SVM_Predict.java

 ## Make sure to install the necessary packages, also Java 22 is needed.
